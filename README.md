# firmware
Firmware for the 2024 MIT Green Team's 2.009 final project. The software entails all power management, data transmission, signal processing, and hardware interface code. The main code can be found in the `ultrasonic_hearing` folder, forked from https://github.com/Foaly/UltrasonicHearing and adapted to run on the Teensy 4.0 Microcontroller.
